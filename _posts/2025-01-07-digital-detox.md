It's the start of a new year, which means I'm diving into the inevitable "new year's resolution." Normally, I dodge these like the plague, brazenly stating things like "time is an illusion," "time isn't even real," or my personal favorite, "wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff!"<sup>1</sup> Yet, here I am, an imperfect human, succumbing to another resolution.

So, what's my resolution this year? As the title suggests, I'm venturing into a digital detox, aiming to inch closer to a life of digital minimalism.

### What Even Is Digital Minimalism?

I've been following [Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com) for a long time. The idea of living a more intentional life—engaging in activities that deepen my relationship with myself and others while having fun—has always appealed to me. Naturally, this means breaking free from the proverbial chains of our Tech Overlords in Silicon Valley! How can I live intentionally when I'm glued to a screen, feeding a multi billion-dollar industry's appetite for my attention?

Sorry, I'll step off my soapbox now.

Anyway, Cal Newport brought many of these ideas to the mainstream around 2016. For instance, in his blog post ["On Digital Minimalism"](https://calnewport.com/on-digital-minimalism/), he defines digital minimalism as:

> "A philosophy that helps you question which digital communication tools (and behaviors surrounding these tools) add the most value to your life. It is motivated by the belief that intentionally and aggressively clearing away low-value digital noise, and optimizing your use of the tools that really matter, can significantly improve your life."

### So, What Is a Digital Detox?

Using the above definition as my guide, I'm aggressively pruning "digital noise" from my life. "Digital noise" is different for everyone, and I'm not about to start prescribing what that should be for you. For me, leaning into "aggressively pruning" feels... right... for now, anyway.

So far, I have done the following:

- Deactivated (not deleted) my Instagram account
- Deleted all other social media from my phone (Snapchat, Bluesky, Discord, and more)
- Blocked Safari on my phone
- Uninstalled all video games from my laptop

I didn't exactly have a grand plan going into this, nor am I following any hard rules. Despite Cal Newport (and r/digitalminimalism) laying out well-crafted "30-day detox"<sup>2</sup> plans, I chose the more chaotic route—just deleting the stuff I know I'm addicted to<sup>3</sup>.

Many detox protocols recommend having a plan to tackle boredom and anxiety during the process, increasing the odds of success. Well... no plan here!

Lastly, I'm not time-boxing this detox. I know myself. If I slap a timebox on it, I'll just count down the days until I can reinstall Instagram and doomscroll once again. I'd rather just go with the flow, as I do with most things.

### Where Am I in the Detox?

As of writing this, I'm on day 1 of the detox. How do I feel? Horrible. Riddled with anxiety, unsure what to do with my hands, and constantly thinking about reinstalling Instagram to satisfy my newly, dopamine-deprived brain. I'm fully prepared for this feeling to linger, which means I should probably schedule some social time or, you know, pick up one of the hobbies I keep saying I'll start.

Despite the doom and gloom, I did manage to write this blog post! That's a win in my book

### Notes

1. "Wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff" is a reference to *Doctor Who*, specifically the Tenth Doctor's explanation of time in the episode "Blink."

3. I have never been clinically diagnosed with addiction. I use the term "addicted" informally to describe my heavy social media and gaming habits. To learn more about internet gaming addiction, [https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/internet-gaming](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/internet-gaming) is a great resource.

**General Note:** This post reflects my personal experience with digital detoxing. Research in this area is ongoing, and what works for me might not work for others. As new studies emerge, the collective understanding of digital addiction and minimalism will likely evolve, providing better frameworks for addressing individual needs.
