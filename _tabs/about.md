Welcome to The Pondering Pen! I’m Corey, and this is where I am attempting to learn in public. I'm a software engineer by trade, but I am dipping my toes into various topics in the humanities. If you’re into philosophy, history, spirituality, or just enjoy reading someone else’s mental gymnastics, you’ll probably feel right at home here.

I don’t have all the answers (or any, really), but I do enjoy asking, exploring, and probing. Stick around to watch me fumble my way to (hopefully) some insightful stuff. Thanks for stopping by—I hope you like what you read!
